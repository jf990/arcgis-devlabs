# ArcGIS DevLabs

ArcGIS DevLabs have turned out to be a popular way to on-board new developers to the ArcGIS platform. The simple lab-based presentation format coupled with an over-arching theme called Data, Design, Develop, has helped introduce the ArcGIS developer tools to both new audiences and existing customers who are interested in fast onboarding with an unfamiliar SDK.

DevLabs have presented the website team an unexpected challenge: new content. We are having difficulty with completing the full lab series for each SDK and keeping the content fresh. We need this to continue to attract new developers and maintain DevLabs effectiveness. We feel a good way to address this is to host a doc-a-thon where we get authors and potential authors together in a place without distractions for a defined period.

## Why DevLabs?

Why do we have DevLabs when we have Guide Doc, Samples, Tutorials, and Example Apps?

DevLabs present a well thought out format to present ArcGIS as a platform to developers and introduce specific platform concepts in a simple, easy to understand and short exercise. While the labs work together as a workflow, any lab can be started and completed on its own. The labs originated from the experiences of our GeoDev Outreach team as they introduced new developers to our SDKs.

DevLabs excel where our other documentation falls short:

- Short, time-boxed exercises (10-15 minutes)
- Provides data and solutions
- Data, Design, Develop covers ArcGIS as a platform
- A specific theme
- The labs work together to complement each other

DevLabs are not a replacement where our other documentation excels:

- Providing in-depth coverage of a topic. DevLabs lean toward lighter, introductory content designed to get the reader into a topic quickly. Guide doc, sample apps, and example apps are better suited to in-depth coverage.
- Detailing the breadth and options of a platform concept. DevLabs are designed to introduce the minimum functionality to achieve success with a given platform feature. The reader will be enticed to learn more with the SDKs documentation.
- Deep background and cross-linking. DevLabs do not overwhelm the reader with details and options. The reader is encouraged to learn more by going to the SDK documentation.

What do your need to author DevLabs?

+ macOS or Windows.
+ Text editor most comfortable with to edit markdown files.
+ Ability to run node.js. We will be using version 8 (current, latest features). Install nodejs from nodejs.org.
+ Access to the ArcGIS for Developers website.
+ Have the developer’s website repo checked out on the master branch in a working directory on your computer.
